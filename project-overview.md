# Project Overview

Project Name: Scribble Scramble: The Exquisite Corpse App

Description: Dive into the hilariously unpredictable world of collaborative storytelling with Scribble Scramble! This web application allows users to contribute one sentence at a time to a shared story, creating bizarre and wonderful narratives through the power of collective imagination. While user accounts and story persistence will be mocked on the frontend, the creative possibilities are endless!

Features:

*   Sentence-by-Sentence Storytelling: Users add one sentence at a time, building upon the previous contributions.
*   Real-time Story Display: Watch the story unfold in real-time as others add their sentences (mocked with simulated updates).
*   "Most Creative Sentence" Voting: Users can vote on their favorite sentences to highlight particularly brilliant or absurd contributions (mocked with a simple counter).
*   Themed Story Starters: Kickstart creativity with a selection of pre-written opening sentences spanning various genres (fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, etc.).
*   Hilarious Random Story Generator:  Generate completely random stories using a library of pre-written sentences for instant laughs and inspiration.
*   Sentence Approval: To begin, all sentences will be displayed right away.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
